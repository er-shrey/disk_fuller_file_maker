# Disk Space Filler

This project is basically intended to fill empty space of the disk drive by creating a file of your size.


# Why it is required?

We know that whenever we delete any file (even permanent delete) from storage device, OS just disconnect the links but do not hard delete i.e. changes the bits in the device for that deleted file.

Sometimes you wanted to sell your system or storage device and there can be chances that the new owner of the system might recover old files by using recovery techniques. For mitigating the risk of original document recovery, we can either hard delete everything (which is an expensive process) or we can replace the data with an irrelevant data. 

## What this project does

This project you to enter the file size in bytes inside the program and just run the program. It will create the specific size of file in the same folder as of the program.

## Requirements

Python installed in your system and a text editor
